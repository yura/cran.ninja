## Help the R-Project

The way R users are looking for new packages could and should be dramatically improved. Right
now they use command line tools like apt / rpm and the package installer of R-Studio to do that job,
but there is not a good web interface for package searching. You will help them. The goal of this
challenge is to build an interface to help the R community. Why?

## What is R?

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which
is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly
AT&T, now Lucent Technologies). It's a cool language, have a look to it if you don't know it yet.

## What is CRAN?

CRAN is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date,
versions of code and documentation for R. The use these CRAN Servers to store the R packages.
A CRAN server looks like: http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/. It is just a simple Apache Dir with a
bunch of tar.gz files.

## PACKAGES file
Every CRAN server contains a plain file listing all the packages in that server. You can access to it
using this URL:
http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/PACKAGES

## Format of PACKAGES file

```
[...]
Package: adehabitatHR
Version: 0.4.2
Depends: R (>= 2.10.0), sp, methods, deldir, ade4, adehabitatMA,
adehabitatLT
Suggests: maptools, tkrplot, MASS, rgeos, gpclib
License: GPL (>= 2)
[...]
```

## Package URL format

You can build the URL of every R package as:
http://cran.rproject.org/src/contrib/[PACKAGE_NAME]_[PACKAGE_VERSION].tar.gz

### Example Package URL:

http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/shape_1.4.1.tar.gz

Inside every package, after you uncompress it, there is a file called DESCRIPTION where you can
get some extra information about the package:

```
DESCRIPTION
Package: abc
Version: 1.6
Date: 2012-16-02
Title: Tools for Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)
Author: Katalin Csillery, Michael Blum and Olivier Francois Maintainer:
Michael Blum Depends: R (>= 2.10), MASS, nnet, quantreg, locfit
Description: The package implements several ABC algorithms for performing
parameter estimation and model selection. Cross-validation tools are also
available for measuring the accuracy of ABC estimates, and to calculate
the misclassification probabilities of different models.
Repository: CRAN

Packaged: 2012-08-14 15:10:43 UTC; mblum
Date/Publication: 2012-08-14 16:27:09
```

## What do we want to do?

We want that you create a JavaScript application to index all the packages in a CRAN server. For
that we want that you do:

1. Extract some information regarding every package and store it (You will need to get some info
from PACKAGES file and some other info from DESCRIPTION)
2. Design the business logic needed for storing all the information (models, libs, DB structure...)
3. A task that will run every day at 12pm to index any new package that appeared during the day
(we want to store all the versions of a given package. It means that the package
abc_1.2.1.tar.gz could be tomorrow abc_1.3.0.tar.gz, and we want to store version 1.2.1 and
1.3.0)
4. A simple view listing all the packages you have indexed
5. Tests, of course
6. Push the code to github and send us the URL.

## Which information do we want to store about a
package?

* Package name
* Version
* Date/Publication
* Title
* Description
* Authors
* Maintainers

Info required about authors/maintainers
* Name
* Email

## Tips

Use the DB you feel more comfortable with. You don't need to index all the packages, but at least
50 of them To read the information, and convert it into hashes, from the files PACKAGES and
DESCRIPTION. Donâ€™t invest more than 4-5 hours. Over engineering could consume your time. We
want to see good code, but you don't need to show off for the sake of showing off. Write honest
code and be pragmatic.
